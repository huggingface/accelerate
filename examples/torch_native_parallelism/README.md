## Torch Native Parallelism

With recent versions of Torch, there have been steady improvements in native parallelism using `DeviceMesh` and `DTensor`. ðŸ¤— accelerate allows you to use these with our `ParallelismConfig` abstraction and/or `FullyShardedDataParallelPlugin(fsdp_version=2)`
This folder contains various examples of such use-cases: such as composing multiple parallelism strategies, low-bit training etc.

### ND Parallelism

With `ParallelismConfig`, you can use ðŸ¤— accelerate to train models with n-dimensional parallelism. This builds on top of ðŸ¤— transformers, which we utilize for tensor parallelism sharding.
Accelerate then takes care of everything else, such as data parallelism, FSDP or context parallelism.
Script `nd_parallel.py` showcases this. We enable you to configure 4 different parallel dimensions (for now ðŸ‘€):
- dp_replicate_size: how many replicas of the model to create, each replica is trained on a different subset of the data and averaged at the end of each step, same as DDP in Torch
- dp_shard_size: across how many devices is the model sharded, this is utilizing FSDP2 to shard the model across devices, so each device has a different part of the model
- tp_size: how many devices to use for tensor parallelism, this is utilizing the tensor parallelism from ðŸ¤— transformers
- cp_size: how many devices to use for context parallelism, this will also shard the model, optimizer and gradients using `FSDP2` across
the same group of devices, to further optimize memory usage (this comes with no slowdown)

For example, with 8 nodes, you can run the script as such:
```bash
accelerate launch --num-processes 8 nd_parallel.py \
    --dp-replicate-size 2 \
    --dp-shard-size 2 \
    --tp-size 2
```

> [!Tip]
> Only use TP intra-node - therefore max TP size you should need is 8. You can also use a lower size, as FSDP (`--dp-shard-size`) can be faster on smaller models with shorter sequence lengths. If you cannot fit your model into memory, utilize `--dp-shard-size` as much as you can. Afterwards, to scale up and utilize all your resources, use `--dp-replicate-size`. This is only a general guideline, you can (and should) experiment with different parallelism configurations to find the best one for your model and hardware. You can learn more about the general strategies for parallelism in our [blog](https://huggingface.co/blog/accelerate-nd-parallel), or if you really want to dive deep, read the [Ultra-Scale Playbook](https://huggingface.co/spaces/nanotron/ultrascale-playbook).


This feature is also fully integrated into ðŸ¤— transformers `Trainer`. To use it, simply launch your script with path to your accelerate configuration file. You can see a minimal example of such script in `nd_parallel_trainer.py`.
We provide 2 pre-configured configuration files:

#### HSDP + TP (3D parallelism)

```bash
accelerate launch --config-file configs/tp_hsdp.yaml nd_parallel_trainer.py
```

#### Context parallelism (128k sequence length)

```bash
accelerate launch --config-file configs/cp.yaml nd_parallel_trainer.py --sequence-length=128000
```

  ### FSDP2 + ao Float8Linear

In file `fsdp2_fp8.py` we use `Float8Linear` from `ao` to train a model partially in FP8 precision. We utilize `AORecipeKwargs` to pass the `Float8LinearConfig` to the accelerator, 
which replaces the default `torch.nn.Linear` with `Float8Linear`. We also utilize `TorchDynamoPlugin` together with regional compilation to compile the model,
gaining even more speed and memory savings, as `ao` doesn't ship with any kernels by default, so we have to gain the performance from compiling the model.

Replacing linear layers with `Float8Linear` can greatly improve performance, if used correctly and on hardware that supports FP8 tensor cores. This highly depends on the model dimensions and sequence length used for training.
You can view the performance of `Float8Linear` as a function of matrix dimensions in [this document](https://github.com/pytorch/ao/blob/main/torchao/float8/README.md#performance). 

In our example, we use a 8B Llama3.1 model, which has a hidden dimension of 4096 and we train on sequence length of 8192. In the below images, we can see that this improves performance by ~25% compared to `bf16`, reaching ~10000 tokens per second, per device on 8x H100 GPUs, compared to ~8000 tokens per second using `bf16`, while loss function stays roughly the same. We can also see that the FLOPS rise by using FP8.

The figures above were generated on 8x H100 SXM GPUs, with 8192 sequence length and 1000 steps. To run the example, you can use the following command, where you can specify the precision to train in:

```bash
accelerate launch fsdp2_fp8.py --sequence-length 8192 --num-steps 1000 --log_with wandb --precision [fp8 | bf16]
```
