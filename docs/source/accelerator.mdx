# Accelerator

The [`Accelerator`] is the main class provided by ðŸ¤— Accelerate. It serves at the main entrypoint for
the API. To quickly adapt your script to work on any kind of setup with ðŸ¤— Accelerate just:

1. Initialize an [`Accelerator`] object (that we will call `accelerator` in the rest of this
   page) as early as possible in your script.
2. Pass along your model(s), optimizer(s), dataloader(s) to the [`~Accelerator.prepare`] method.
3. (Optional but best practice) Remove all the `.cuda()` or `.to(device)` in your code and let the
   `accelerator` handle device placement for you.
4. Replace the `loss.backward()` in your code by `accelerator.backward(loss)`.
5. (Optional, when using distributed evaluation) Gather your predictions and labels before storing them or using
   them for metric computation using [`~Accelerator.gather`].

This is all that is needed in most cases. For more advanced cases or a nicer experience here are the functions you
should search for and replace by the corresponding methods of your `accelerator`:

- `print` statements should be replaced by [`~Accelerator.print`] to be only printed once per
  process.
- Use [`~Accelerator.is_local_main_process`] for statements that should be executed once per server.
- Use [`~Accelerator.is_main_process`] for statements that should be executed once only.
- Use [`~Accelerator.wait_for_everyone`] to make sure all processes join that point before continuing
  (useful before a model save for instance).
- Use [`~Accelerator.unwrap_model`] to unwrap your model before saving it.
- Use [`~Accelerator.save`] instead of `torch.save`.
- Use [`~Accelerator.clip_grad_norm_`] instead of `torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_` and
  [`~Accelerator.clip_grad_value_`] instead of `torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_value_`.
