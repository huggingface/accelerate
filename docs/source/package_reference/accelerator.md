# Accelerator

The [`Accelerator`] is the main class provided by 🤗 Accelerate. 
It serves at the main entry point for the API. 

## Quick adaptation of your code

To quickly adapt your script to work on any kind of setup with 🤗 Accelerate just:

1. Initialize an [`Accelerator`] object (that we will call `accelerator` throughout this page) as early as possible in your script.
2. Pass your dataloader(s), model(s), optimizer(s), and scheduler(s) to the [`~Accelerator.prepare`] method.
3. Remove all the `.cuda()` or `.to(device)` from your code and let the `accelerator` handle the device placement for you. 

<Tip>

    Step three is optional, but considered a best practice.

</Tip>

4. Replace `loss.backward()` in your code with `accelerator.backward(loss)`
5. Gather your predictions and labels before storing them or using them for metric computation using [`~Accelerator.gather`]

<Tip warning={true}>

    Step five is mandatory when using distributed evaluation
    
</Tip>

In most cases this is all that is needed. The next section lists a few more advanced use cases and nice features
you should search for and replace by the corresponding methods of your `accelerator`:

## Advanced recommendations

### Printing

`print` statements should be replaced by [`~Accelerator.print`] to be printed once per process:

```diff
- print("My thing I want to print!")
+ accelerator.print("My thing I want to print!")
```

### Executing processes

#### Once on a single server

For statements that should be executed once per server, use [`~Accelerator.is_local_main_process`]:

```python
if accelerator.is_local_main_process:
    do_thing_once_per_server()
```

A function can be wrapped using the [`~Accelerator.on_local_main_process`] function to achieve the same 
behavior on a function's execution:

```python
@accelerator.on_local_main_process
def do_my_thing():
    "Something done once per server"
    do_thing_once_per_server()
```

#### Only ever once across all servers

For statements that should only ever be executed once, use [`~Accelerator.is_main_process`]:

```python
if accelerator.is_main_process:
    do_thing_once()
```

A function can be wrapped using the [`~Accelerator.on_main_process`] function to achieve the same 
behavior on a function's execution:

```python
@accelerator.on_main_process
def do_my_thing():
    "Something done once per server"
    do_thing_once()
```

#### On specific processes

If a function should be ran on a specific overall or local process index, there are similar decorators 
to achieve this:

```python
@accelerator.on_local_process(local_process_idx=0)
def do_my_thing():
    "Something done on process index 0 on each server"
    do_thing_on_index_zero_on_each_server()
```

```python
@accelerator.on_process(process_index=0)
def do_my_thing():
    "Something done on process index 0"
    do_thing_on_index_zero()
```

### Synchronicity control

Use [`~Accelerator.wait_for_everyone`] to make sure all processes join that point before continuing. (Useful before a model save for instance).

### Saving and loading

```python
model = MyModel()
model = accelerator.prepare(model)
```

Use [`~Accelerator.save_model`] instead of `torch.save` to save a model. It will remove all model wrappers added during the distributed process, get the state_dict of the model and save it. The state_dict will be in the same precision as the model being trained.

```diff
- torch.save(state_dict, "my_state.pkl")
+ accelerator.save_model(model, save_directory)
```

[`~Accelerator.save_model`] can also save a model into sharded checkpoints or with safetensors format.
Here is an example: 

```python
accelerator.save_model(model, save_directory, max_shard_size="1GB", safe_serialization=True)
```

#### 🤗 Transformers models

If you are using models from the [🤗 Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/) library, you can use the `.save_pretrained()` method.

```python
from transformers import AutoModel

model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("bert-base-cased")
model = accelerator.prepare(model)

# ...fine-tune with PyTorch...

unwrapped_model = accelerator.unwrap_model(model)
unwrapped_model.save_pretrained(
    "path/to/my_model_directory",
    is_main_process=accelerator.is_main_process,
    save_function=accelerator.save,
)
```

This will ensure your model stays compatible with other 🤗 Transformers functionality like the `.from_pretrained()` method.

```python
from transformers import AutoModel

model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("path/to/my_model_directory")
```

### Operations

Use [`~Accelerator.clip_grad_norm_`] instead of ``torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_`` and [`~Accelerator.clip_grad_value_`] instead of ``torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_value``

### Gradient Accumulation

To perform gradient accumulation use [`~Accelerator.accumulate`] and specify a gradient_accumulation_steps. 
This will also automatically ensure the gradients are synced or unsynced when on 
multi-device training, check if the step should actually be performed, and auto-scale the loss:

```diff
- accelerator = Accelerator()
+ accelerator = Accelerator(gradient_accumulation_steps=2)

  for (input, label) in training_dataloader:
+     with accelerator.accumulate(model):
          predictions = model(input)
          loss = loss_function(predictions, labels)
          accelerator.backward(loss)
          optimizer.step()
          scheduler.step()
          optimizer.zero_grad()
```
#### GradientAccumulationPlugin
[[autodoc]] utils.GradientAccumulationPlugin


Instead of passing `gradient_accumulation_steps` you can instantiate a GradientAccumulationPlugin and pass it to the [`Accelerator`]'s `__init__`
as `gradient_accumulation_plugin`. You can only pass either one of `gradient_accumulation_plugin` or `gradient_accumulation_steps` passing both will raise an error.
```diff
from accelerate.utils import GradientAccumulationPlugin

gradient_accumulation_plugin = GradientAccumulationPlugin(num_steps=2)
- accelerator = Accelerator()
+ accelerator = Accelerator(gradient_accumulation_plugin=gradient_accumulation_plugin)
```

In addition to the number of steps, this also lets you configure whether or not you adjust your learning rate scheduler to account for the change in steps due to accumulation.
