# Handling big models

When loading a pretrained model in PyTorch, the usual workflow looks like this:

```py
import torch

my_model = ModelClass(...)
state_dict = torch.load(checkpoint_file)
my_model.load_state_dict(state_dict)
```

In plain English, those steps are:
1. Create the model with randomly initialized weights
2. Load the model weights (in a dictionary usually called a state dict) from the disk
3. Load those weights inside the model

While this works very well for regularly sized models, this workflow has some clear limitation when we deal with a huge model: in step 1, we load a full version of the model in RAM, and spend some time randomly initializing the weights (which will be discarded in step 3). In step 2, we load another full version of the model in RAM, with the pretrained weights. If you're loading a model with 6 billions parameters, this needs you will need 24GB of RAM for each copy of the model, so 48GB in total (half of it to load the model in FP16).

## Instantiating an empty model

The first tool Accelerate introduces to help with big models is a context manager [`init_empty_weights`] that helps you initialize a model without using any RAM, so that step 1 can be done on models of any size. Here is how it works:

```py
from accelerate import init_empty_weights

with init_empty_weights():
    my_model = ModelClass(...)
```

For instance:

```py
with init_empty_weights():
    model = nn.Sequential(*[nn.Linear(10000, 10000) for _ in range(1000)])
```

initializes an empty model with a bit more than 100B parameters. Behind the scenes, this relies on the meta device introduced in PyTorch 1.9. During the initialization under the context manager, each time a parameter is created, it is instantly moved on that device.

<Tip warning={true}>

You can't move a model initialized like this on CPU or another device directly, since it doesn't have any data. It's also very likely that a forward pass with that empty model will fail, as not all operations are supported on the meta device.

</Tip>

## Sharded checkpoints

It's possible your model is so big that even a single copy won't fit in RAM. That doesn't mean it can't be loaded: if you have one or several GPUs, this is more memory available to store your model. In this case, it's better if your checkpoint is split in several smaller files that we call checkpoint shards.

Accelerate will handle sharded checkpoints as long as you follow the following format: your checkpoint should be in a folder, with several files containing the partial state dicts, and there should be an index in the JSON format that contains a dictionary mapping parameter names to the file containing their weights. For instance we could have a folder containing:

```bash
first_state_dict.bin
index.json
second_state_dict.bin
```

with index.json being the following file:

```
{
  "linear1.weight": "first_state_dict.bin",
  "linear1.bias": "first_state_dict.bin",
  "linear2.weight": "second_state_dict.bin",
  "linear2.bias": "second_state_dict.bin"
}
```

and `first_state_dict.bin` containing the weights for `"linear1.weight"` and `"linear1.bias"`, `second_state_dict.bin` the ones for `"linear2.weight"` and `"linear2.bias"`

## Loading weights

The second tool Accelerate introduces is a function [`load_checkpoint_and_dispatch`], that will allow you to load a checkpoint inside your empty model. This supports full checkpoints (a single file containing the whole state dict) as well as sharded checkpoints. It will also automatically dispatch those weights across the devices you have available (GPUs, CPU RAM), so if you are loading a sharded checkpoint, the maximum RAM usage will be the size of the biggest shard.

Here is how we can use this to load the [GPT-J-6B](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B) model. You clone the sharded version of this model with:

```bash
git clone https://huggingface.co/sgugger/sharded-gpt-j-6B
cd sharded-gpt-j-6B
git-lfs install
git pull
```

then we can initialize the model with

```py
from accelerate import init_empty_weights
from transformers import AutoConfig, AutoModelForCausalLM

checkpoint = "EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B"
config = AutoConfig.from_pretrained(checkpoint)

with init_empty_weights():
    model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_config(config)
```

and load the checkpoint we just downloaded with:

```py
from accelerate import load_checkpoint_and_dispatch

model = load_checkpoint_and_dispatch(
    model, "sharded-gpt-j-6B", device_map="auto", no_split_module_classes=["GPTJBlock"]
)
```

By passing `device_map="auto"`, we tell Accelerate to determine automatically where to put each layer of the model depending on the available resources:
- first we use the maximum space available on the GPU(s)
- if we still need space, we store the remaining weights on the CPU
- if there is not enough RAM, we store the remaining weights on the hard drive as memory-mapped tensors

`no_split_module_classes=["GPTJBlock"]` indicates that the modules that are `GPTJBlock` should not be split on different devices. You should set here all blocks that include a residual connection of some kind.

You can see the `device_map` that Accelerate picked by accessing the `hf_device_map` attribute of your model:

```py
model.hf_device_map
```

```python out
{'transformer.wte': 0,
 'transformer.drop': 0,
 'transformer.h.0': 0,
 'transformer.h.1': 0,
 'transformer.h.2': 0,
 'transformer.h.3': 0,
 'transformer.h.4': 0,
 'transformer.h.5': 0,
 'transformer.h.6': 0,
 'transformer.h.7': 0,
 'transformer.h.8': 0,
 'transformer.h.9': 0,
 'transformer.h.10': 0,
 'transformer.h.11': 0,
 'transformer.h.12': 0,
 'transformer.h.13': 0,
 'transformer.h.14': 0,
 'transformer.h.15': 0,
 'transformer.h.16': 0,
 'transformer.h.17': 0,
 'transformer.h.18': 0,
 'transformer.h.19': 0,
 'transformer.h.20': 0,
 'transformer.h.21': 0,
 'transformer.h.22': 0,
 'transformer.h.23': 0,
 'transformer.h.24': 1,
 'transformer.h.25': 1,
 'transformer.h.26': 1,
 'transformer.h.27': 1,
 'transformer.ln_f': 1,
 'lm_head': 1}
 ```

You can also design your `device_map` yourself, if you prefer to explicitly decide where each layer should be. In this case, the command above becomes:

```py
model = load_checkpoint_and_dispatch(model, "sharded-gpt-j-6B", device_map=my_device_map)
```

## Run the model

Now that we have done this, our model lies across several devices, and maybe the hard drive. But it can still be used as a regular PyTorch model:

```py
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(checkpoint)
inputs = tokenizer("Hello, my name is", return_tensors="pt")
inputs = inputs.to(0)
output = model.generate(inputs["input_ids"])
tokenizer.decode(output[0].tolist())
```

Behind the scenes, Accelerate added hooks to the model, so that:
- at each layer, the inputs are put on the right device (so even if your model is spread across several GPUs, it works)
- for the weights offloaded on the CPU, they are put on a GPU just before the forward pass, and cleaned up just after
- for the weights offloaded on the hard drive, they are loaded in RAM then put on a GPU just before the forward pass, and cleaned up just after

This way, you model can run for inference even if it doesn't fit on one of the GPUs or the CPU RAM!
