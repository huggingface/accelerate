# Accelerate

ðŸ¤— Accelerate is a library that allows the same PyTorch code be ran across any distributed configuration by adding just four lines of code!

Built on `torch_xla` and `torch.distributed`, Accelerate wraps around the tough and problematic code changes that need to occur on each of these
platforms seperately so you don't have to. In minutes existing codebases can be converted to utilize [DeepSpeed](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed), perform [fully sharded data parallelism](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/fsdp), and have automatic support for mixed-precision training!
