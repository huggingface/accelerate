# Checkpointing

When training a PyTorch model with 🤗 Accelerate, you may often want to save and continue a state of training. Doing so requires
saving and loading the model, optimizer, RNG generators, and the GradScaler. Inside 🤗 Accelerate are two convenience functions to achieve this quickly:
- Use [`~Accelerator.save_state`] for saving everything mentioned above to a folder location passed to [`~Accelerator.init`]
- Use [`~Accelerator.load_state`] for loading everything stored from an earlier `save_state`

It should be noted that the expectation is that those states come from the same training script, they should not be from two separate scripts.

- By using [`~Accelerator.register_for_checkpointing`], you can register custom objects to be automatically stored or loaded from the two prior functions,
so long as the object has a `state_dict` **and** a `load_state_dict` functionality. This could include objects such as a learning rate scheduler. 

Below is a brief example using checkpointing to save and reload a state during training:

```python
from accelerate import Accelerator
import torch

accelerator = Accelerator(project_dir="my/save/path")

my_scheduler = torch.optim.lr_scheduler.StepLR(my_optimizer, step_size=1, gamma=0.99)
my_model, my_optimizer, my_training_dataloader = accelerator.prepare(my_model, my_optimizer, my_training_dataloader)

# Register the LR scheduler
accelerator.register_for_checkpointing(my_scheduler)

# Save the starting state
accelerator.save_state()

device = accelerator.device
my_model.to(device)

# Perform training
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for batch in my_training_dataloader:
        my_optimizer.zero_grad()
        inputs, targets = batch
        inputs = inputs.to(device)
        targets = targets.to(device)
        outputs = my_model(inputs)
        loss = my_loss_function(outputs, targets)
        accelerator.backward(loss)
        my_optimizer.step()
    my_scheduler.step()

# Restore previous state
accelerator.load_state("my/save/path/checkpointing/checkpoint_0")
```
