# Amazon SageMaker

Hugging Face and Amazon introduced new [Hugging Face Deep Learning Containers (DLCs)](https://github.com/aws/deep-learning-containers/blob/master/available_images.md#huggingface-training-containers) to
make it easier than ever to train Hugging Face Transformer models in [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/).

## Getting Started

### Setup & Installation


Before you can run your ðŸ¤— Accelerate scripts on Amazon SageMaker you need to sign up for an AWS account. If you do not
have an AWS account yet learn more [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/gs-set-up.html).

After you have your AWS Account you need to install the `sagemaker` sdk for ðŸ¤— Accelerate with:

```bash
pip install "accelerate[sagemaker]" --upgrade
```

ðŸ¤— Accelerate currently uses the ðŸ¤— DLCs, with `transformers`, `datasets` and `tokenizers` pre-installed. ðŸ¤—
Accelerate is not in the DLC yet (will soon be added!) so to use it within Amazon SageMaker you need to create a
`requirements.txt` in the same directory where your training script is located and add it as dependency:

```
accelerate
```

You should also add any other dependencies you have to this `requirements.txt`.


### Configure ðŸ¤— Accelerate

You can configure the launch configuration for Amazon SageMaker the same as you do for non SageMaker training jobs with
the ðŸ¤— Accelerate CLI:

```bash
accelerate config
# In which compute environment are you running? ([0] This machine, [1] AWS (Amazon SageMaker)): 1
```

ðŸ¤— Accelerate will go through a questionnaire about your Amazon SageMaker setup and create a config file you can edit.

<Tip>

    ðŸ¤— Accelerate is not saving any of your credentials.

</Tip>

### Prepare a ðŸ¤— Accelerate fine-tuning script

The training script is very similar to a training script you might run outside of SageMaker, but to save your model
after training you need to specify either `/opt/ml/model` or use `os.environ["SM_MODEL_DIR"]` as your save
directory. After training, artifacts in this directory are uploaded to S3:


```diff
- torch.save('/opt/ml/model`)
+ accelerator.save('/opt/ml/model')
```

<Tip warning={true}>

    SageMaker doesnâ€™t support argparse actions. If you want to use, for example, boolean hyperparameters, you need to
    specify type as bool in your script and provide an explicit True or False value for this hyperparameter. [[REF]](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/frameworks/pytorch/using_pytorch.html#prepare-a-pytorch-training-script).

</Tip>

### Launch Training

You can launch your training with ðŸ¤— Accelerate CLI with:

```
accelerate launch path_to_script.py --args_to_the_script
```

This will launch your training script using your configuration. The only thing you have to do is provide all the
arguments needed by your training script as named arguments.

**Examples**

<Tip>

    If you run one of the example scripts, don't forget to add `accelerator.save('/opt/ml/model')` to it.

</Tip>

```bash
accelerate launch ./examples/sagemaker_example.py
```

## Advanced Features

### Distributed Training: Data Parallelism

Set up the accelerate config by running `accelerate config` and answer the SageMaker questions and set it up.
To use SageMaker DDP, select it when asked 
`What is the distributed mode? ([0] No distributed training, [1] data parallelism):`.
Example config below:
```yaml
base_job_name: accelerate-sagemaker-1
compute_environment: AMAZON_SAGEMAKER
distributed_type: DATA_PARALLEL
ec2_instance_type: ml.p3.16xlarge
iam_role_name: xxxxx
image_uri: null
mixed_precision: fp16
num_machines: 1
profile: xxxxx
py_version: py38
pytorch_version: 1.10.2
region: us-east-1
transformers_version: 4.17.0
use_cpu: false
```

### Distributed Training: Model Parallelism

*currently in development, will be supported soon.*

### Python packages and dependencies

ðŸ¤— Accelerate currently uses the ðŸ¤— DLCs, with `transformers`, `datasets` and `tokenizers` pre-installed. If you
want to use different/other Python packages you can do this by adding them to the `requirements.txt`. These packages
will be installed before your training script is started.

### Remote scripts: Use scripts located on Github
