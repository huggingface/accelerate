# Tracking

There are a large number of experiment tracking API's available, however getting them all to work with in a multi-processing environment can oftentimes be complex.
🤗 Accelerate provides a general tracking API that can be used to log useful items during your script through [`Accelerator.log`]

## Integrated Trackers

Currently `Accelerate` supports four trackers out-of-the-box:

- TensorBoard
- WandB
- CometML
- MLFlow

To use any of them, pass in the selected type(s) to the `log_with` parameter in [`Accelerate`]:
```python
from accelerate import Accelerator
from accelerate.utils import LoggerType

accelerator = Accelerator(log_with="all")  # For all available trackers in the environment
accelerator = Accelerator(log_with="wandb")
accelerator = Accelerator(log_with=["wandb", LoggerType.TENSORBOARD])
```

At the start of your experiment [`Accelerator.init_trackers`] should be used to setup your project, and potentially add any experiment hyperparameters to be logged:
```python
hps = {"num_iterations": 5, "learning_rate": 1e-2}
accelerator.init_trackers("my_project", config=hps)
```

When you are ready to log any data, [`Accelerator.log`] should be used.
A `step` can also be passed in to correlate the data with a particular step in the training loop.
```python
accelerator.log({"train_loss": 1.12, "valid_loss": 0.8}, step=1)
```

Once you've finished training, make sure to run [`Accelerator.end_training`] so that all the trackers can run their finish functionalities if they have any.
```python
accelerator.end_training()
```


A full example is below:
```python
from accelerate import Accelerator

accelerator = Accelerator(log_with="all")
config = {
    "num_iterations": 5,
    "learning_rate": 1e-2,
    "loss_function": str(my_loss_function),
}

accelerator.init_trackers("example_project", config=config)

my_model, my_optimizer, my_training_dataloader = accelerate.prepare(my_model, my_optimizer, my_training_dataloader)
device = accelerator.device
my_model.to(device)

for iteration in config["num_iterations"]:
    for step, batch in my_training_dataloader:
        my_optimizer.zero_grad()
        inputs, targets = batch
        inputs = inputs.to(device)
        targets = targets.to(device)
        outputs = my_model(inputs)
        loss = my_loss_function(outputs, targets)
        accelerator.backward(loss)
        my_optimizer.step()
        accelerator.log({"training_loss": loss}, step=step)
accelerator.end_training()
```

If a tracker requires a directory to save data to such as `TensorBoard` then a `logging_dir` or `project_dir` can be passed in. `project_dir` is useful 
if there are other further configurations such as those which can be combined with the [`~utils.ProjectConfiguration`] dataclass.

```python
accelerator = Accelerator(log_with="tensorboard", logging_dir=".")
```

## Implementing Custom Trackers

To implement a new tracker to be used in `Accelerator`, a new one can be made through implementing the [`GeneralTracker`] class.
Every tracker must implement three functions and have three properties:
  - `__init__`: 
    - Should store a `run_name` and initialize the tracker API of the integrated library. 
    - If a tracker stores their data locally (such as TensorBoard), a `logging_dir` parameter can be added.
  - `store_init_configuration`: 
    - Should take in a `values` dictionary and store them as a one-time experiment configuration
  - `log`: 
    - Should take in a `values` dictionary and a `step`, and should log them to the run

  - `name` (`str`):
    - A unique string name for the tracker, such as `"wandb"` for the wandb tracker. 
    - This will be used for interacting with this tracker specifically
  - `requires_logging_directory` (`bool`):
    - Whether a `logging_dir` is needed for this particular tracker and if it uses one.
  - `tracker`: 
    - This should be implemented as a `@property` function 
    - Should return the internal tracking mechanism the library uses, such as the `run` object for `wandb`.

Each method should also utilize the [`state.PartialState`] class if the logger should only be executed on the main process for instance.

A brief example can be seen below with an integration with Weights and Biases, containing only the relevant information and logging just on 
the main process:
```python
from accelerate.tracking import GeneralTracker, on_main_process
from typing import Optional

import wandb


class MyCustomTracker(GeneralTracker):
    name = "wandb"
    requires_logging_directory = False

    @on_main_process
    def __init__(self, run_name: str):
        self.run_name = run_name
        run = wandb.init(self.run_name)

    @property
    def tracker(self):
        return self.run.run

    @on_main_process
    def store_init_configuration(self, values: dict):
        wandb.config(values)

    @on_main_process
    def log(self, values: dict, step: Optional[int] = None):
        wandb.log(values, step=step)
```

When you are ready to build your `Accelerator` object, pass in an **instance** of your tracker to [`Accelerator.log_with`] to have it automatically
be used with the API:

```python
tracker = MyCustomTracker("some_run_name")
accelerator = Accelerator(log_with=tracker)
```

These also can be mixed with existing trackers, including with `"all"`:

```python
tracker = MyCustomTracker("some_run_name")
accelerator = Accelerator(log_with=[tracker, "all"])
```

## Accessing the internal tracker 

If some custom interactions with a tracker might be wanted directly, you can quickly access one using the 
[`Accelerator.get_tracker`] method. Just pass in the string corresponding to a tracker's `.name` attribute 
and it will return that tracker on the main process.

This example shows doing so with wandb:

```python
wandb_tracker = accelerator.get_tracker("wandb")
```

From there you can interact with `wandb`'s `run` object like normal:

```python
wandb_run.log_artifact(some_artifact_to_log)
```

<Tip>
  Trackers built in Accelerate will automatically execute on the correct process, 
  so if a tracker is only meant to be ran on the main process it will do so 
  automatically.
</Tip>

If you want to truly remove Accelerate's wrapping entirely, you can 
achieve the same outcome with:

```python
wandb_tracker = accelerator.get_tracker("wandb", unwrap=True)
with accelerator.on_main_process:
    wandb_tracker.log_artifact(some_artifact_to_log)
```


## When a wrapper cannot work

If a library has an API that does not follow a strict `.log` with an overall dictionary such as Neptune.AI, logging can be done manually under an `if accelerator.is_main_process` statement:
```diff
  from accelerate import Accelerator
+ import neptune.new as neptune

  accelerator = Accelerator()
+ run = neptune.init(...)

  my_model, my_optimizer, my_training_dataloader = accelerate.prepare(my_model, my_optimizer, my_training_dataloader)
  device = accelerator.device
  my_model.to(device)

  for iteration in config["num_iterations"]:
      for batch in my_training_dataloader:
          my_optimizer.zero_grad()
          inputs, targets = batch
          inputs = inputs.to(device)
          targets = targets.to(device)
          outputs = my_model(inputs)
          loss = my_loss_function(outputs, targets)
          total_loss += loss
          accelerator.backward(loss)
          my_optimizer.step()
+         if accelerator.is_main_process:
+             run["logs/training/batch/loss"].log(loss)
```
