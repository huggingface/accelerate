# Notebook Launcher

Launch your training function inside a notebook. Currently supports launching a training with TPUs on [Google
Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and [Kaggle kernels](https://www.kaggle.com/code), as well as training on
several GPUs (if the machine on which you are running your notebook has them).

An example can be found in [this notebook](https://github.com/huggingface/notebooks/blob/master/examples/accelerate/simple_nlp_example.ipynb).

<Tip warning={true}>

Your `Accelerator` object should only be defined inside the training function. This is because the
initialization should be done inside the launcher only.
