class LocalSGD:
    """
    A helper class to support local SGD on top of Accelerator. It simply runs a given number of updates independently
    on each device, and averages model weights every K synchronization step.

    It should be used only in the multi-GPU (or multi-CPU) setup without extensions such as DeepSpeed. In particular,
    this is a simple implementation that cannot support scenarios such as model parallelism.


    Although we are not aware of the true origins of this simple approach, the idea of local SGD is quite old and goes
    back to at least:

    Zhang, J., De Sa, C., Mitliagkas, I., & RÃ©, C. (2016). [Parallel SGD: When does averaging help?. arXiv preprint
    arXiv:1606.07365.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07365)

    We credit the term Local SGD to the following paper (but there might be earlier references we are not aware of).

    Stich, Sebastian Urban. ["Local SGD Converges Fast and Communicates Little." ICLR 2019-International Conference on
    Learning Representations. No. CONF. 2019.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.09767)
