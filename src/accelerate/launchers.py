    Launches a training function, using several processes or multiple nodes if it's possible in the current environment
    (TPU with multiple cores for instance).

    <Tip warning={true}>

    To use this function absolutely zero calls to a CUDA device must be made in the notebook session before calling. If
    any have been made, you will need to restart the notebook and make sure no cells use any CUDA capability.

    Setting `ACCELERATE_DEBUG_MODE="1"` in your environment will run a test before truly launching to ensure that none
    of those calls have been made.

    </Tip>

    Args:
        function (`Callable`):
            The training function to execute. If it accepts arguments, the first argument should be the index of the
            process run.
        args (`Tuple`):
            Tuple of arguments to pass to the function (it will receive `*args`).
        num_processes (`int`, *optional*):
            The number of processes to use for training. Will default to 8 in Colab/Kaggle if a TPU is available, to
            the number of GPUs available otherwise.
        mixed_precision (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"no"`):
            If `fp16` or `bf16`, will use mixed precision training on multi-GPU.
        use_port (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"29500"`):
            The port to use to communicate between processes when launching a multi-GPU training.
        master_addr (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"127.0.0.1"`):
            The address to use for communication between processes.
        node_rank (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 0):
            The rank of the current node.
        num_nodes (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 1):
            The number of nodes to use for training.
