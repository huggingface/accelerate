    used when testing to see if `complete_*_.py` examples have all of the implementations from each of the

    It utilizes `nlp_example.py` to extract out all of the repeated training code, so that only the new additional code
    is examined and checked. If something *other* than `nlp_example.py` should be used, such as `cv_example.py` for the
    `complete_cv_example.py` script, it should be passed in for the `secondary_filename` parameter.
