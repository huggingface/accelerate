    """
    Wraps a PyTorch `BatchSampler` to generate batches for one of the processes only. Instances of this class will
    always yield a number of batches that is a round multiple of `num_processes` and that all have the same size.
    Depending on the value of the `drop_last` attribute of the batch sampler passed, it will either stop the iteration
    at the first batch that would be too small / not present on all processes or loop with indices from the beginning.

    Args:
        batch_sampler (`torch.utils.data.sampler.BatchSampler`):
            The batch sampler to split in several shards.
        num_processes (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 1):
            The number of processes running concurrently.
        process_index (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 0):
            The index of the current process.
        split_batches (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether the shards should be created by splitting a batch to give a piece of it on each process, or by
            yielding different full batches on each process.

            On two processes with a sampler of `[[0, 1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6, 7]]`, this will result in:

            - the sampler on process 0 to yield `[0, 1, 2, 3]` and the sampler on process 1 to yield `[4, 5, 6, 7]` if

    """
    Wraps a PyTorch `DataLoader` to generate batches for one of the processes only.

    Depending on the value of the `drop_last` attribute of the `dataloader` passed, it will either stop the iteration
    at the first batch that would be too small / not present on all processes or loop with indices from the beginning.

    Args:
        dataloader (`torch.utils.data.dataloader.DataLoader`):
            The data loader to split across several devices.
        device (`torch.device`):
            The target device for the returned `DataLoader`.
        num_processes (`int`, *optional*):
            The number of processes running concurrently. Will default to the value given by
            [`~state.AcceleratorState`].
        process_index (`int`, *optional*):
            The index of the current process. Will default to the value given by [`~state.AcceleratorState`].
        split_batches (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether the resulting `DataLoader` should split the batches of the original data loader across devices or
            yield full batches (in which case it will yield batches starting at the `process_index`-th and advancing of
            `num_processes` batches at each iteration).

            Another way to see this is that the observed batch size will be the same as the initial `dataloader` if
            this option is set to `True`, the batch size of the initial `dataloader` multiplied by `num_processes`
            otherwise.

            Setting this option to `True` requires that the batch size of the `dataloader` is a round multiple of
            `batch_size`.
        put_on_device (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether or not to put the batches on `device` (only works if the batches are nested list, tuples or
            dictionaries of tensors).
        rng_types (list of `str` or [`~utils.RNGType`]):
            The list of random number generators to synchronize at the beginning of each iteration. Should be one or
            several of:

            - `"torch"`: the base torch random number generator
            - `"cuda"`: the CUDA random number generator (GPU only)
            - `"xla"`: the XLA random number generator (TPU only)
            - `"generator"`: the `torch.Generator` of the sampler (or batch sampler if there is no sampler in your
              dataloader) or of the iterable dataset (if it exists) if the underlying dataset is of that type.

        dispatch_batches (`bool`, *optional*):
            If set to `True`, the datalaoder prepared is only iterated through on the main process and then the batches
            are split and broadcast to each process. Will default to `True` when the underlying dataset is an
            `IterableDataset`, `False` otherwise.

    Returns:
        `torch.utils.data.dataloader.DataLoader`: A new data loader that will yield the portion of the batches

    <Tip warning={true}>

    This does not support `BatchSampler` with varying batch size yet.
