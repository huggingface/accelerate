            Whether the resulting :obj:`DataLoader` should split the batches of the original data loader across devices
            or yield full batches (in which case it will yield batches starting at the :obj:`process_index`-th and
            advancing of :obj:`num_processes` batches at each iteration).

            Another way to see this is that the observed batch size will be the same as the initial :obj:`dataloader`
            if this option is set to :obj:`True`, the batch size of the initial :obj:`dataloader` multiplied by
            :obj:`num_processes` otherwise.

            Setting this option to :obj:`True` requires that the batch size of the :obj:`dataloader` is a round
            multiple of :obj:`batch_size`.
        put_on_device (:obj:`bool`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`False`):
            Whether or not to put the batches on :obj:`device` (only works if the batches are nested list, tuples or
            dictionaries of tensors).
        rng_types (list of :obj:`str` or :class:`~accelerate.utils.RNGType`):
            The list of random number generators to synchronize at the beginning of each iteration. Should be one or
            several of:

            - :obj:`"torch"`: the base torch random number generator
            - :obj:`"cuda"`: the CUDA random number generator (GPU only)
            - :obj:`"xla"`: the XLA random number generator (TPU only)
            - :obj:`"generator"`: the :obj:`torch.Generator` of the sampler (or batch sampler if there is no sampler in
              your dataloader) or of the iterable dataset (if it exists) if the underlying dataset is of that type.

        dispatch_batches (:obj:`bool`, `optional`):
            If set to :obj:`True`, the datalaoder prepared is only iterated through on the main process and then the
            batches are split and broadcast to each process. Will default to :obj:`True` when the underlying dataset is
            an :obj:`IterableDataset`, :obj:`False` otherwise.

    Returns:
        :obj:`torch.utils.data.dataloader.DataLoader`: A new data loader that will yield the portion of the batches

    .. warning::

        This does not support :obj:`BatchSampler` with varying batch size yet.
