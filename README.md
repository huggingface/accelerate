## Easy to integrate

ðŸ¤— Accelerate was created for PyTorch users who like to write the training loop of PyTorch models but are reluctant to write and maintain the boilerplate code needed to use multi-GPUs/TPU/fp16.

ðŸ¤— Accelerate abstracts exactly and only the boilerplate code related to multi-GPUs/TPU/fp16 and leaves the rest of your code unchanged.

Here is an example:

```diff
  import torch
  import torch.nn.functional as F
  from datasets import load_dataset
+ from accelerate import Accelerator

+ accelerator = Accelerator()
- device = 'cpu'
+ device = accelerator.device

  model = torch.nn.Transformer().to(device)
  optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters())

  dataset = load_dataset('my_dataset')
  data = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(dataset, shuffle=True)

+ model, optimizer, data = accelerator.prepare(model, optimizer, data)

  model.train()
  for epoch in range(10):
      for source, targets in data:
          source = source.to(device)
          targets = targets.to(device)

          optimizer.zero_grad()

          output = model(source)
          loss = F.cross_entropy(output, targets)

-         loss.backward()
+         accelerator.backward(loss)

          optimizer.step()
```

As you can see in this example, by adding 5-lines to any standard PyTorch training script you can now run on any kind of single or distributed node setting (single CPU, single GPU, multi-GPUs and TPUs) as well as with or without mixed precision (fp8, fp16, bf16).

In particular, the same code can then be run without modification on your local machine for debugging or your training environment.

ðŸ¤— Accelerate even handles the device placement for you (which requires a few more changes to your code, but is safer in general), so you can even simplify your training loop further:

```diff
  import torch
  import torch.nn.functional as F
  from datasets import load_dataset
+ from accelerate import Accelerator

- device = 'cpu'
+ accelerator = Accelerator()

- model = torch.nn.Transformer().to(device)
+ model = torch.nn.Transformer()
  optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters())

  dataset = load_dataset('my_dataset')
  data = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(dataset, shuffle=True)

+ model, optimizer, data = accelerator.prepare(model, optimizer, data)

  model.train()
  for epoch in range(10):
      for source, targets in data:
-         source = source.to(device)
-         targets = targets.to(device)

          optimizer.zero_grad()

          output = model(source)
          loss = F.cross_entropy(output, targets)

-         loss.backward()
+         accelerator.backward(loss)

          optimizer.step()
```

## Launching script

ðŸ¤— Accelerate also provides an optional CLI tool that allows you to quickly configure and test your training environment before launching the scripts. No need to remember how to use `torch.distributed.run` or to write a specific launcher for TPU training!
On your machine(s) just run:

```bash
accelerate config
```

and answer the questions asked. This will generate a config file that will be used automatically to properly set the default options when doing

```bash
accelerate launch my_script.py --args_to_my_script
``` 

For instance, here is how you would run the GLUE example on the MRPC task (from the root of the repo):

```bash
accelerate launch examples/nlp_example.py
```

This CLI tool is **optional**, and you can still use `python my_script.py` or `python -m torchrun my_script.py` at your convenience.

You can also directly pass in the arguments you would to `torchrun` as arguments to `accelerate launch` if you wish to not run` accelerate config`.

For example, here is how to launch on two GPUs:

```bash
accelerate launch --multi_gpu --num_processes 2 examples/nlp_example.py
```

To learn more, check the CLI documentation available [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/package_reference/cli).

## Launching multi-CPU run using MPI

ðŸ¤— Here is another way to launch multi-CPU run using MPI. You can learn how to install Open MPI on [this page](https://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=building#easy-build). You can use Intel MPI or MVAPICH as well.
Once you have MPI setup on your cluster, just run:

```bash
mpirun -np 2 python examples/nlp_example.py
```

## Launching training using DeepSpeed

ðŸ¤— Accelerate supports training on single/multiple GPUs using DeepSpeed. To use it, you don't need to change anything in your training code; you can set everything using just `accelerate config`. However, if you desire to tweak your DeepSpeed related args from your Python script, we provide you the `DeepSpeedPlugin`.

```python
from accelerate import Accelerator, DeepSpeedPlugin

# deepspeed needs to know your gradient accumulation steps beforehand, so don't forget to pass it
# Remember you still need to do gradient accumulation by yourself, just like you would have done without deepspeed
deepspeed_plugin = DeepSpeedPlugin(zero_stage=2, gradient_accumulation_steps=2)
accelerator = Accelerator(mixed_precision='fp16', deepspeed_plugin=deepspeed_plugin)

# How to save your ðŸ¤— Transformer?
accelerator.wait_for_everyone()
unwrapped_model = accelerator.unwrap_model(model)
unwrapped_model.save_pretrained(save_dir, save_function=accelerator.save, state_dict=accelerator.get_state_dict(model))
```

Note: DeepSpeed support is experimental for now. In case you get into some problem, please open an issue.

## Launching your training from a notebook

ðŸ¤— Accelerate also provides a `notebook_launcher` function you can use in a notebook to launch a distributed training. This is especially useful for Colab or Kaggle notebooks with a TPU backend. Just define your training loop in a `training_function` then in your last cell, add:

```python
from accelerate import notebook_launcher

notebook_launcher(training_function)
```

An example can be found in [this notebook](https://github.com/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/examples/accelerate_examples/simple_nlp_example.ipynb). [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/examples/accelerate_examples/simple_nlp_example.ipynb)

## Why should I use ðŸ¤— Accelerate?

You should use ðŸ¤— Accelerate when you want to easily run your training scripts in a distributed environment without having to renounce full control over your training loop. This is not a high-level framework above PyTorch, just a thin wrapper so you don't have to learn a new library. In fact, the whole API of ðŸ¤— Accelerate is in one class, the `Accelerator` object.

## Why shouldn't I use ðŸ¤— Accelerate?

You shouldn't use ðŸ¤— Accelerate if you don't want to write a training loop yourself. There are plenty of high-level libraries above PyTorch that will offer you that, ðŸ¤— Accelerate is not one of them.
